# Python Weather App
During my first semester at university, I embarked on a project to develop a weather application using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI. This project, which integrates with APIs from OpenWeatherMap and IPStack, provides users with real-time weather updates based on either their input city or their current geographical location.

Key Features:
 - City-Based Weather Search: Users can input any city name to retrieve comprehensive weather details, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather conditions.
 - Current Location Weather: Utilizes IPStack API to detect the userâ€™s current geographical location automatically and displays the corresponding weather information.
 - User-Friendly Interface: Designed a clean and intuitive interface with Tkinter, ensuring ease of use for all users.
 - Detailed Weather Information: Displays critical weather data such as temperature in Celsius, feels-like temperature, humidity, pressure, cloudiness, and descriptive weather conditions.
 - Sunrise and Sunset Times: Includes local sunrise and sunset times, enhancing the utility of the app.

Technologies Used:
 - Python: Core programming language for backend logic and data processing.
 - Tkinter: Library for creating the graphical user interface.
 - OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching weather data.
 - IPStack API: For determining user location based on IP address.
 - JSON: For parsing and handling API responses.

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply and expand my skills in Python programming, API integration, and GUI development. It provided practical experience in handling real-time data and creating user-centric applications. The project underscored the importance of a well-designed interface and the seamless integration of multiple data sources to deliver a robust user experience.
